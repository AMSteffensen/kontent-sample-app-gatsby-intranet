# Material UI Paperbase Starter for Gatsby with Kentico Cloud ðŸ”¥

Create dashboards and administration tools in Gastby using [Material UI's](https://material-ui.com/) [Paperbase Premium Theme](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/docs/src/pages/premium-themes/paperbase) and [Kentico Cloud](http://kenticocloud.com).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd cloud-sample-app-intranet-gatsby
    gatsby develop
    ```

1. **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `cloud-sample-app-intranet-gatsby` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
